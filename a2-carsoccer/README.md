# My solution to Assignment 2

#Work in the "C" Range:
1. The boundary of the pitch and each goal are set up successfully by drawing lines.
2. The ball can move with a random initial velocity and can be relaunched by pressing the space bar.
3. The position and velocity of the ball are updated each time step and are affected by the acceleration of gravity.
4. It can detect a contact between the ball and the ground, and the ball will be bounced in the correct direction.

#Work in the "B" Range:
1. Detection can be found when the ball hits the walls and the ceiling, and the ball would bounce off.
2. The car cannot leave the pitch.
3. The speed of the ball will be decreased when it bounces due to some air drag.


#Work in the "A" Range:
1. The contact between the ball and the car responds correctly.
2. The ball would go faster when it hits the car with larger velocity.
3. The car always move forwards or backwards by pressing up and down keys, it cannot go sideways. The left and right keys can rotate the car.
4. When the balls hits one of the goals, the car will be reset and the ball will be relaunched.
